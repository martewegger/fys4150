### Instructions for running the code in project 3

This projects uses a cpp module for computing energy and magnetisation values for the 2D Ising model for a given lattice size, temperature, initial state and burn in time. The python file run.py is used to compile and run the cpp class for one set of input parameters. Further analysis is performed using only python scripts that call on the run.py file to compute energy and magnetisation.

ac.py produces results related to exercise a-c. Similarly de.py and fg.py produces results related  to exercises d-e and f-g. The file find_burn_N.py estimates the maximum burn in time needed(L=100, T=2.4) and produces a plot to illustrate this.
